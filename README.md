# UrbanBikeInsights

Welcome to UrbanBikeInsights - your gateway to unlocking the secrets of urban mobility through data-driven analysis of the New York Citi Bike dataset. In this repository, I delved into the intricate dynamics of bike-sharing usage patterns, user behaviors, and spatial-temporal trends, offering valuable insights and recommendations for optimizing bike-sharing services in urban environments.

## Project Overview

UrbanBikeInsights is a comprehensive project that explores the New York Citi Bike dataset sourced from Kaggle. With over 50,000 rows and 18 columns of detailed trip information, this dataset provides a wealth of opportunities for uncovering patterns and trends in urban mobility. My project encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, geospatial analysis, clustering, linear regression, and visualization using tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and Python libraries.

## Key Highlights

- **Thorough Data Cleaning:** I meticulously clean and validate the dataset, ensuring data quality and reliability for subsequent analysis.
- **Ethical Considerations:** I addressed privacy concerns, data biases, and ethical use of data, ensuring fair treatment and respect for user privacy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and exploratory questions, I uncovered insights into Citi Bike usage patterns, user demographics, and temporal trends.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Utilizing geospatial techniques, I analyzed the spatial distribution of Citi Bike start stations, trip durations, and usage patterns across New York City.
- **Clustering Analysis:** I segmented Citi Bike users into distinct groups based on behavior patterns, enabling targeted marketing strategies and service optimization.
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** I examined the relationship between trip durations and distances between start and end stations, providing insights into user behaviors and potential service enhancements.
- **Tableau Analysis:** Through interactive visualizations, I compared subscriber and non-subscriber behaviors, identify usage patterns, and offer recommendations for service optimization and marketing strategies.
